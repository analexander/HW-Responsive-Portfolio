CSS and Bootstrap: Responsive Portfolio

By Angel Alexander

My Portfolio page takes you to an About Me page and has a navbar at the top to go to Contact or Portfolio pages. It is responsive when viewed on different sized viewports. I used a lot of Bootstrap styling and some of my own styling on top to make it my own!
